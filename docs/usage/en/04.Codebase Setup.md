# Snow CLI User Guide - Initial Configuration

Welcome to Snow CLI! Agentic coding in your terminal.

## Codebase Setup

Snow CLI supports enabling local codebase functionality.

_The codebase is a vector search-based SQLite database used to store source code and comments from your codebase, with natural language query capabilities through vectorization._

- The codebase supports two request schemes: Jina (OpenAI-compatible) and Ollama (local deployment, supports both OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` and native `/api/embed`).

- Codebase BaseURL (multiple forms supported; Snow CLI will auto-normalize to the final endpoint):

  - Jina (OpenAI-compatible) supports: `https://api.jina.ai`, `https://api.jina.ai/v1`, `https://api.jina.ai/v1/embeddings` (final request: `.../v1/embeddings`).
  - Ollama supports: `http://localhost:11434`, `http://localhost:11434/v1`, `http://localhost:11434/v1/embeddings` (OpenAI-compatible); and `http://localhost:11434/api`, `http://localhost:11434/api/embed` (Ollama native).

- Embedding Dimensions: Enter the dimensions supported by your embedding model. Some providers may ignore the `dimensions` parameter; Snow CLI will log a warning if the returned dimensions don’t match.

- Chunking Configuration: Configure how code is split into chunks for indexing. These settings control the size and overlap of code segments:
  - `maxLinesPerChunk`: Maximum lines per chunk (default: 200)
  - `minLinesPerChunk`: Minimum lines per chunk (default: 10)
  - `minCharsPerChunk`: Minimum characters per chunk (default: 20)
  - `overlapLines`: Lines overlapping between consecutive chunks (default: 20)
    These settings affect search accuracy and indexing performance.
- Batch Processing: Control how files are processed in batches for efficient indexing:
  - `maxLines`: Maximum lines per batch request (default: 10)
  - `concurrency`: Number of concurrent batch operations (default: 3)
    This controls the number of `input` items sent to the embedding API per request.

**Note: Maximum batch lines refers to the number of `input` items in the request body, not the number of lines in code slices**

## Related Features

After enabling codebase indexing, the following features will be significantly enhanced:

- [Vulnerability Hunting Mode](./11.Vulnerability%20Hunting%20Mode.md) - Codebase indexing can greatly improve accuracy and efficiency of security analysis
- [Command Panel Guide](./9.Command%20Panel%20Guide.md) - Use `/reindex` to rebuild codebase index
