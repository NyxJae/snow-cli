## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to restart Snow CLI after changing theme?**

A: No. Theme changes take effect immediately and apply to current interface and all subsequent operations.

**Q: Where is the custom theme configuration file?**

A: Configuration file is located at `~/.snow/theme.json`, can be manually edited or configured through interface.

**Q: Can I use different themes for different projects?**

A: Currently theme is global configuration, shared by all projects. If needed, can temporarily modify configuration file before launching Snow CLI.

**Q: Can the preview area code examples be customized?**
