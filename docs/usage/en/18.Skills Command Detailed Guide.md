# Snow CLI Usage Documentation - Skills Command Detailed Guide

Skills is a powerful extension feature of Snow CLI that allows you to create and use specialized knowledge bases and toolkits. Each skill contains professional knowledge and practical tools in specific domains, which can be invoked in conversations through the `skill-execute` tool.

## Skills Overview

The Skills feature of Snow CLI is fully compatible with **Claude Code Skills**. You can:

- Create custom skills to encapsulate domain-specific knowledge and tools
- Reuse common task patterns and best practices
- Share skills across different projects
- Restrict tool access permissions for skills
- Create standardized development processes for teams

### Skill Types

Skills are mainly divided into the following categories:

- **Tool Skills**: Provide encapsulation and usage methods for specific tools (e.g., slack-gif-creator)
- **Knowledge Skills**: Contain professional knowledge and best practices in specific domains
- **Template Skills**: Provide reusable code, document, or configuration templates
- **Workflow Skills**: Define standardized task execution processes

## Skill Structure

Each skill is a directory containing the following standard structure:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Main document (required)
├── core/             # Core code modules
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py       # Main logic
│   └── utils.py      # Utility functions
├── templates/        # Template files
│   ├── template1.md
│   └── template2.txt
├── scripts/          # Auxiliary scripts
│   ├── setup.sh
│   └── process.py
├── requirements.txt  # Dependency list
└── LICENSE.txt       # License file
```

### SKILL.md Main Document

The main document is the core of a skill, containing:

- **YAML Front Matter**: Defines skill name, description, allowed tools, etc.
- **Detailed Instructions**: Skill functionality, usage methods, API reference
- **Code Examples**: Code snippets showing how to use the skill
- **Best Practices**: Usage tips and precautions

````markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Detailed description of the skill
allowed-tools: tool1, tool2, tool3
license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt

## Skill Locations

Skills can be stored in two locations:

- **Global Location**: `~/.snow/skills/`

  - Available in all projects
  - Suitable for general, cross-project skills

- **Project Location**: `.snow/skills/`
  - Only available in the current project
  - Suitable for project-specific skills

**Priority**: Project-level skills override global skills with the same name

## Creating Skills

Use the `/skills` command to create new skills:

1. Type `/skills` to open the skill creation dialog
2. Enter a skill name (lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, max 64 characters)
3. Enter a skill description
4. Select storage location (global or project)
5. Confirm creation

After creation, the system automatically generates:

- SKILL.md (main document)
- Necessary directory structure
- Basic template files

## Using Skills

### Use `/skills-` to open the Skills picker (inject into the input)

`/skills-` is a shortcut command (similar to `/agent-` and `/todo-`) that opens a picker panel. It lets you select an existing skill and inject its content into the current input box as an injection block, so you can include that skill prompt in your next message.

How it differs from `/skills`:

- `/skills`: creates a new skill template (generates the directory and `SKILL.md`, etc.).
- `/skills-`: selects from existing skills and injects the skill content into the input (does not create files).

How to open:

- Type `/skills-` in the input and press Enter; or pick `skills-` from the command panel (Enter).

Panel interactions (default behavior):

- Up/Down: change selected skill (wrap-around).
- Tab: toggle focus between the "search" field and the "append" field.
- Enter: confirm selection and inject.
- Esc: close the panel and return to input.

What gets injected (full internal text):

- An injection block starting with `# Skill: <skill-id>` and ending with `# Skill End`.
- In the input UI it is rendered as a placeholder: `[Skill:<skill-id>] ` (note the trailing space so you can continue typing).
- When you send the message, the full injection block is sent (not just the placeholder).

How "append" works:

- If the skill markdown contains the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder, it will be replaced with the append text.
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is not present, a `[User Append]` block will be appended (only when append is non-empty).

Notes:

- The injected end marker `# Skill End` must end with a newline. Otherwise, if you keep typing after the placeholder, it may get glued to the end marker and cause display masking to collapse unintended text.
- Skill sources are `.snow/skills/` (project) and `~/.snow/skills/` (global). When IDs collide, project skills take priority.

### Invoking in Conversations (direct tool invocation)

Use the `skill-execute` tool to invoke skills:

```

skill: "skill-name"

```

After invocation, you will see:

```

<command-message>The "skill-name" skill is loading</command-message>

```

Subsequently, the skill content will expand, providing detailed guidance and usage instructions.

### Usage Examples

#### slack-gif-creator Skill Example

This is a complete skill example for creating animated GIFs suitable for Slack:

```python
# Load the skill
skill: "slack-gif-creator"

# The skill will provide detailed usage guidance, including:
# - Slack's GIF requirements (dimensions, framerate, colors, etc.)
# - How to use the GIFBuilder tool class
# - Animation effect implementation (shake, pulse, bounce, etc.)
# - Optimization techniques

# For example, creating an animated GIF
from core.gif_builder import GIFBuilder
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

# Create builder
builder = GIFBuilder(width=128, height=128, fps=10)

# Generate frames
for i in range(12):
    frame = Image.new('RGB', (128, 128), (240, 248, 255))
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(frame)

    # Draw animation
    # ... drawing code ...

    builder.add_frame(frame)

# Save optimized GIF
builder.save('output.gif', num_colors=48, optimize_for_emoji=True)
```

## Skill Management

### Listing Available Skills

All available skills are listed in the `skill-execute` tool description, including:

- Skill name
- Skill description
- Skill location (global/project)

### Deleting Skills

Delete custom skills using the `-d` parameter:

- **Delete global skill**: `/skill-name -d` (execute in non-project directory)
- **Delete project skill**: `/skill-name -d` (execute in project directory)

The system automatically identifies the skill location and deletes the corresponding files.

### Skill Restrictions

You can restrict tool access for skills through the `allowed-tools` field:

```yaml
---
name: restricted-skill
description: Skill with restricted tool access
allowed-tools: filesystem-read, filesystem-edit, terminal-execute
---
```

This ensures that skills can only use specified safe tools, improving system security.
